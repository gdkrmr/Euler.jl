# Project Euler


From https://projecteuler.net:

> Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

> The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

# Euler.jl

This is a julia package that contains preset functions and code to verify the results.

## How to use it:

Start a Julia REPL in this directory and activate the project

```julia
] activate .
```

Open [./src/Euler.jl](./src/Euler.jl) in a text editor. Each function has a link to the problem description. Read it and try to complete the function.

The package tests will verify the results. Results were taken from  https://github.com/luckytoilet/projecteuler-solutions/blob/master/Solutions.md

The package tests will check your results. You can run the tests with

```julia
] test
```

I have not tested if all the solutions are valid! I you think your solution is
correct and the test is not, please let me know!

# Note

Pick your fight! There are 857 problems to solve! There will be many that will be too complicated, just choose the ones you feel comfortable with!
